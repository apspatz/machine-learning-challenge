# machine-learning-challenge

For this challenge, I chose to try 4 models: Trees, Random Forest, K Nearest Neighbors, and a Neural Network. In order from most able to predict to least able to predict: (1) Neural Network (70.1% accuracy), (2) Trees (61.3% accuracy), (3) Random Forest (60.4% accuracy), and (4) K Nearest Neighbors (52.3% accuracy).  For the bottom three models, attempting to hypertune the models did not prove to help much as the default parameters reported the best.  Specifically, the K Nearest Neighbors model proved the hardest to get any good data out of...it was essentially a guessing game as to what value of K to use.  I settled on K=19 after graphing the K values, but only because it was moderately more consistant that any of the other values.  The neural network ended up having the best results, though I had to iterate the model through 500 epochs with a rather large loss (0.685).  The neural network model struggled to even reach the 70% during training.

Based on these models, I probably wouldn't rely on them heavily to find exoplanets.  The neural network may have given the best results in finding the planets, but I would probably want to tweak that more by adding in another layer and playing around with how many units at each layer so see if the model could get above 75% before relying on it. The other three models I would toss out completely, as they were almost always as wrong as they were right.
